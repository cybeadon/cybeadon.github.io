Posts can be written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ "Markdown"){:target="_blank"} format and customize it with just HTML and CSS knowledge.
Sites built using Jekyll can be hosted using any static server. Also it can be hosted in [Github pages](https://pages.github.com "Github Pages"){:target="_blank"} for free.
